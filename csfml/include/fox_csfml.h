/*
** This module tries to reproduce an object oriented environment for CSFML
** projects as well as give the users a handy toolbox for this same lib.
**
** You're probably wondering why not just use an OOP binding of SFML, or
** even just SFML instead... Well, the answer to that question is on line 2
** of every single source and header that composes this lib.
**
** Anyway don't hesitate and dig in the headers, they're well commentend.
** ... At least for the ones that you need to understand to use the module.
**
** I hope this makes your experiences with CSFML better !
